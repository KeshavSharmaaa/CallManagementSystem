python app.py


Server runs at:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

🌐 Frontend Pages

Manager Dashboard

/manager/dashboard.html


Call Insights Page

/manager/insight-calls.html

🔗 Key API Endpoint
GET /api/call/manager/call-logs


Returns AI-processed call data including metrics, risk levels, and transcripts.

🔐 Cybersecurity & Data Protection During Calls

SalesMS follows security-by-design principles to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of call data.

🛡️ Secure Architecture

Frontend handles display only

Backend controls data processing and storage

No direct access to server files from the browser

🔑 Authentication & Authorization

Token-based authentication for protected pages

Unauthorized users are redirected or blocked

APIs validate access before returning sensitive data

🔒 Secure Calling (Twilio + WebRTC)

Twilio handles call routing securely

WebRTC manages real-time signaling

Socket.IO events are authenticated

Prevents call hijacking and spoofing

🎙️ Secure Recording & Upload

Call recordings uploaded via backend APIs only

Stored in protected backend directories

Not exposed via public URLs

🧠 Secure AI Processing

Audio processed server-side

Transcription and analysis isolated from frontend

Only summarized insights returned to the UI

🚫 Attack Mitigation
Threat	Protection
Unauthorized access	Token-based authentication
File leakage	Backend-only storage
Call hijacking	Authenticated signaling
Data tampering	API-only writes
XSS	Escaped transcript rendering
